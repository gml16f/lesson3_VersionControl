            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is Git? Git is known for its ability to store data as a series of snapshots of a smaller filesystem. Think of Git as some sort of a reference system. Git stores a snapshot of what your files look like a the moment and stores that photo to use as a reference if ever needed. It is important to know that all Git operations are local and store the entire project on a local disk to promote efficiency. This topic interests me because before this class, I did not know what Git was used for. Since we will be using Git for the remained of the class, it’s important to understand it’s importance and use.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Taking it back, Git was actually developed through a collaboration of Linux Systems, which is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the Linux Kernel. Thanks to the Linux Systems, Git has been extremely helpful to its users’ due to its swift speed, user-friendly design and use, and its ability to withhold large projects. So- in conclusion, I am happy to be able to use this in class due to its efficiency. It is important to know about the backstory of Git to understand why we use it and how it could potentially benefit us when doing our assignments.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is Version Control? Well, Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific version later. In understanding version control, we can get a better idea of what Git is. Why is Version Control helpful? These Version Control Systems are helpful because they it is able to store all our images, downloads, documents, etc. If we were to lose any of that information for any reason, Version Control Systems would allow for us to recover the lost files. Version Control is extremely necessary when dealing with our assignments since we are working with a lot of data and information. Since we are dealing with many documents and files to turn in, Version Control Systems will secure its’ safety.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git, one is typically known to start “recording” snapshots of their changes each time they feel confident that their work needs to be recorded. There are two important words to consider – one being “tracked” which are the files that Git knows about and that can be modified or unmodified and “untracked” which are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When a repository is first clones it will be both track and unmodified because nothing has been changed yet. But as the files are changes, Git will then update them using Version Control Systems. It is quite important to understand repositories especially due to the fact that we will editing them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As we should know by now, Git is known for its ability to store data as a series of snapshots of a smaller filesystem. With that being said, there are a few Git functions that are good to know. Let’s start with Git log. Git log has the ability to show all the backups created in the repository. Git status, on the other hand shows that status of each folder and important information such as when they were last changed, backed up, and added to the staging area. Lastly, Git diff shows the difference between the older repositories and the current directory. Pretty cool, right? Understanding Git is essential for passing this course. That is why it is important to know its’ fundamentals and its function.
